    <h1>United Nations of Minecraft</h1> 

    <p> Welcome to the UNM Archives! Here you can find info on our treaties.</p> 
<h1>-----------------------------------------------</h1>

<h3>Current Treaties</h3>
<ul>
     <li><a href="#blackmarket">The Black Market Agreement</a></li>
     <li><a href="#slavetreaty">The Slave Treaty</a></li>
     <li><a href="#terrorism">The Acts of Terrorism Treaty</a></li>
</ul>

    <h3>So what is the archive used for?</h3>
    <p>The archives are a MASSIVE liabrary of the UNM treaty documents. Here I will type out the treaties and their details. (Note: Working on a custom domain..)</p>
 <h1>-----------------------------------------------</h1>

    <h3>What are our treaties?<h3>
    <p>Our treaties are ideas that at least three of four countried of the UNM have agreed upon. These can range from Black Markets to Terrorism.</p>
<h1> -----------------------------------------------</h1>

 <h3>So how does a treaty get signed and what does it need?</h3> 
<p>Well a treaty has to have at least 3/4 signatures and votes to approve. And each one must deal with a serious problem such as Terrorism, Slave Owning, Illegal Weapons, etc. <br>
But what makes them a treaty is how much the writer pours into it. Without the writer actually caring and wanting to do something about that subject, the treaty is just a piece of unwanted paper..
<h1> -----------------------------------------------</h1>    
<h3 id="blackmarket">The Black Market Agreement</h3>

<p>By signing this all countries agree that lethal weapons that do 9+ damage can only be legally sold on the black market (location not yet determined). Sales should be private and discreet. On the black market you can hire mercenaries, sell players, buy and sell weapons of mass destruction, and host currency giveaways. <br> 
<br>
Signatures 4/4
 </p>
<h1> -----------------------------------------------</h1>

<h3 id="slavetreaty">The Slave Treaty</h3>

<p> This treaty is still in work but it will mostly be an agreement about selling players to work for other players</p>
<h1> -----------------------------------------------</h1>

<h3 id="terrorism">Acts of Terrorism Treaty</h3>

<p>This treaty is pending on 2 more votes. It covers acts of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction such as bomber jets, remote bombs and suicide bombs.
<h1> -----------------------------------------------</h1>

<h3 id="copyright-stuff">All of these treaties abide by the rules of UNM.</h3>
